# Excel_Kickstarter
* Homework 1 for UPenn Data Analytics to use pivot tables, pivot charts, and many other excel functions to analyze kickstarter data and find market trends based on the analysis

### Starting Data 
* The starting spreadsheet, KickStarter_Starting_Data.xlsx, for this repo has over 4,000 kickstarter projects. 
* The columns in the starting spreadsheet are id, name, blurb, goal, pledged, state, country, currency, deadline, launched_at, staff_pick, backers_count, spotlight, and Category and Sub-Category. Each row in the dataset is one kickstarter campaign.

### Analysis / Results

#### Cleaning Data
* When you are working with any new dataset the first two things that you should always do are one make sure that you understand the data and two make sure that the data is in a form that you can perform analysis on it. That is exactly what I did for this project. The column headers made the starting dataset very easy to understand. Then, I became to clean the data. Most of the columns were in a form that I could easily work with. However, deadline, launched_at, and Category and Sub Category were not in forms that I could use. Deadline and launched_at are meant to be dates but they are not in the starting dataset so I used the Date function to convert the values in these columns to dates. Next, I did not like how category and sub-category were in the same column so I used a spilt function so that Category and Sub-Category had their own columns. Finally I calculated the average donation per backer and percent funded. After making these changes the updated spreadsheet looks like this:
